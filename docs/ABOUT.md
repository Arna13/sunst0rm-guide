# About sunst0rm

sunst0rm is an iPhone tethered downgrade script by [mineek](https://github.com/mineek) with some code by [M1n1Exploit](https://github.com/Mini-Exploit).

What is a tethered downgrade?
  - Tethered downgrades are a kind of downgrade that **needs** a computer to start the iPhone.
  - Tethered downgrades are only possible to use on devices vulnerable to the checkm8 bootrom exploit. 
  - This method allows to downgrade to any [**SEP compatible version**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1Mb1UNm6g3yvdQD67M413GYSaJ4uoNhLgpkc7YKi3LBs/htmlview) without the need of saved blobs.

Who is this script for?
  - This script can be useful for people who want to downgrade to an earlier version of iOS on a compatible device but don't have blobs saved.
  - This can be useful for people with a spare iphone that want to get jailbreak on their iPhone and dont want to wait until iOS 15 jailbreak. (Note: Some JBs may not work with a tethered downgrade, such as checkra1n. We recommend using Taurine, which is known to work.)
  - This script is intended for people who know what they're doing. Tethered downgrdes are not something we recommend doing on a main device, since it can let your phone inaccesible without a computer to turn it on. If you are not familiar with computers, we do not recommend following this guide since you will just be running commands without much idea about what they do, which can potentially be dangerous. **I strongly suggest you never run commands you see on the internet without understanding what they do!**

What should I know before tether downgrading?
  - A10+ devices will encounter problems on a downgraded version of iOS, please check for known problems of downgrading your phone before attempting this!
  - Any device should be able to be restored to the latest version of iOS via Finder.
